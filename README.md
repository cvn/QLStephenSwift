# QLStephenSwift

A modern QuickLook extension for macOS that allows you to preview plain text files without file extensions.

## Overview

QLStephenSwift is a complete rewrite of the legacy [QLStephen](https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen) project using Swift and the latest macOS QuickLook framework. It provides QuickLook previews for text files that don't have file extensions, such as:

- README
- Makefile
- CHANGELOG
- LICENSE
- Shell scripts without extensions
- Configuration files
- And many more...

## Features

- ✅ Pure Swift implementation using modern QuickLook Extension framework
- ✅ Automatic text/binary file detection
- ✅ Comprehensive encoding support:
  - BOM detection (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 BE/LE)
  - ISO-2022-JP escape sequence detection
  - Strict UTF-8 validation (RFC 3629 compliant)
  - ICU statistical analysis for legacy encodings
  - CJK encodings (Japanese, Korean, Chinese)
  - Western encodings (Windows-1252, MacRoman)
- ✅ Intelligent encoding detection with priority-based fallback
- ✅ Configurable maximum file size limit
- ✅ **Line number display** (optional, configurable separator)
- ✅ **RTF rendering** with customizable fonts, colors, and tab widths
- ✅ **Line ending preservation** (LF, CR, CRLF automatically detected and maintained)
- ✅ macOS 15+ compatible (no external process dependencies)
- ✅ Excludes binary files and `.DS_Store`
- ✅ Empty files preview as blank text

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode 16.0 or later (for building)

## Installation

Installable via Homebrew Cask: `brew tap MyCometG3/qlstephenswift && brew install --cask qlstephenswift`

### Pre-built Application

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/MyCometG3/QLStephenSwift/releases)
2. Unzip and copy `QLStephenSwift.app` to `/Applications` folder
3. Launch the application once to register the QuickLook extension

### Building from Source

1. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MyCometG3/QLStephenSwift.git
   cd QLStephenSwift
   open QLStephenSwift/QLStephenSwift.xcodeproj
   ```
2. Build and run the project (⌘R)

### Activation (Required for both methods)

1. Enable the extension in System Settings:
   - **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Extensions → Quick Look**
   - Enable "QLStephenSwift Extension"

2. Reset QuickLook cache and restart Finder:
   ```bash
   qlmanage -r && qlmanage -r cache
   killall Finder
   ```

## Configuration

### Maximum Text File Size

Configure the maximum text file size for preview (default: 100KB, range: 100KB-10MB):

```bash
defaults write group.com.mycometg3.qlstephenswift maxFileSize 204800  # 200KB
```

Valid range: 102400-10485760 bytes (100KB-10MB)

This setting controls preview truncation for text files only. See [File Size Limits](#file-size-limits) for details on how this interacts with binary detection.

### Line Numbers and RTF Rendering

New features for enhanced text preview:

- **Line Numbers**: Display line numbers with configurable separator (space, colon, pipe, tab)
- **RTF Rendering**: Rich text output with customizable fonts, colors, and tab widths

These features can be enabled/disabled via the application UI. For detailed configuration options and advanced settings, see [FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md).

### Migration from Original QLStephen

Settings are automatically migrated from the original QLStephen on first launch. For manual migration:

```bash
OLD_SIZE=$(defaults read com.whomwah.quicklookstephen maxFileSize 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$OLD_SIZE" ] && defaults write com.mycometg3.qlstephenswift maxFileSize -int $OLD_SIZE
```

## Usage

Simply select any text file without an extension in Finder and press the Space bar to preview it with QuickLook.

## Supported Content Types

- `public.data` - Generic data files
- `public.content` - Content files
- `public.unix-executable` - Unix executable files (displays shell scripts with shebangs)

### Why Not `public.plain-text` or `public.text`?

This extension intentionally does **not** declare support for `public.plain-text` or `public.text` UTIs. Here's why:

**macOS Quick Look Precedence Rules:**
- System Quick Look generators (located in `/System/Library/QuickLook/`) take precedence over third-party extensions for common UTIs like `public.plain-text` and `public.text`
- When both system and third-party extensions support the same UTI, the **system plugin wins** for core/native file types
- Third-party extensions are only used when the system doesn't have a strong handler for that UTI

**Our Strategy:**
- By using generic UTIs (`public.data`, `public.content`), this extension can preview files that the system doesn't handle well
- This is particularly effective for **files without extensions** (like `README`, `Makefile`, `LICENSE`) - the core use case for this extension
- If we declared `public.plain-text`, the system's text handler would take over for `.txt` files and most recognized text files, defeating the purpose

**Result:**
- Files without extensions → handled by this extension (via `public.data`)
- Files with `.txt` or recognized text extensions → handled by system Quick Look
- This division of labor ensures the extension fills the gap where the system falls short

For more details on Quick Look UTI precedence, see [Apple's Quick Look documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook/).

## Technical Details

### Binary Detection

Adaptive reading strategy based on file size:
- **Files ≤5MB**: Entire file loaded for encoding detection and complete text decoding
- **Files >5MB**: First 8KB sampled to minimize memory usage

Binary classification rules (applied to sampled data):
- **Immediate rejection**: Any null byte (0x00) → classified as binary
- **Statistical analysis**: Control characters (excluding TAB/LF/CR/FF/ESC) > 30% → classified as binary
  - ESC (0x1B) is allowed for ISO-2022-JP escape sequences
- **Zero-byte files**: Treated as UTF-8 text/plain to allow blank previews

### File Size Limits

The preview system uses two independent size limits that serve different purposes:

**Binary Detection (Analysis Phase)**
- Files ≤5MB: Entire file loaded for accurate encoding detection
- Files >5MB: First 8KB sampled to minimize memory usage
- This is a hardcoded limit in `FileAnalyzer.swift` for the analysis phase

**Preview Display (Rendering Phase)**
- Controlled by "Max Text File Size" setting in app UI (default: 100KB, max: 10MB)
- Text files exceeding this limit are truncated in preview
- Does not affect binary detection—truncation occurs after text validation
- Configurable via UI or `defaults write` command

These limits are sequential and independent:
1. First, binary detection runs (using 5MB threshold for sampling strategy)
2. If file passes as text, preview truncation applies (using user-configured limit)

This means setting "Max Text File Size" above 5MB is valid—binary detection will still use sampling for files >5MB, but the full text content (up to the configured limit) will be displayed in preview.

### Line Ending Handling

The formatter automatically detects and preserves the original line ending style:
- **LF** (`\n`) - Unix/Linux/macOS
- **CRLF** (`\r\n`) - Windows
- **CR** (`\r`) - Classic Mac OS

Detection uses single-pass iteration for efficiency, and the original style is maintained throughout formatted output.

### Encoding Detection

Multi-stage detection with priority-based fallback to minimize false positives:

1. **BOM Detection** (highest priority)
   - UTF-8, UTF-16 BE/LE, UTF-32 BE/LE

2. **ISO-2022-JP Escape Sequence Detection**
   - Detects ISO-2022-JP by checking for escape sequences (ESC $ B, ESC ( B, etc.)
   - Must be checked before UTF-8 validation (ISO-2022-JP uses only ASCII bytes)

3. **Strict UTF-8 Validation** (RFC 3629 compliant)
   - Validates byte sequence structure
   - Rejects overlong encodings and invalid code points

4. **ICU Statistical Detection**
   - Uses Foundation's `NSString.stringEncoding(for:)` with no encoding suggestions
   - Empty suggestions allow ICU to use full statistical analysis without bias
   - Provides heuristic-based detection for legacy encodings

5. **Priority-based Fallback** (in order of strictness and regional relevance)
   - Japanese: ISO-2022-JP (safety net), EUC-JP, Shift-JIS
   - Korean: EUC-KR
   - Chinese: GB18030, Big5, GB2312
   - Western: Windows-1252, MacRoman
   - UTF-16/32 BE/LE without BOM (rare, last resort)

6. **Lossy UTF-8** (final fallback)
   - Replaces invalid sequences with U+FFFD replacement characters

## Why QLStephenSwift?

The original QLStephen uses legacy QuickLook Generator plugins with Objective-C and external dependencies (`file` command, `libmagic`). These aren't available in modern macOS sandbox environments.

QLStephenSwift modernizes the approach:
- ✅ Pure Swift implementation with modern QuickLook Extension framework
- ✅ No external dependencies (compatible with macOS 15+ sandbox)
- ✅ Enhanced encoding detection (CJK languages, strict UTF-8 validation)
- ✅ App Extension architecture for better security and reliability

## Troubleshooting

### QuickLook not showing previews

1. Verify extension is enabled: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Extensions → Quick Look**
2. Reset QuickLook: `qlmanage -r && qlmanage -r cache`
3. Restart Finder: `killall Finder`
4. Check which extension handles files: `qlmanage -m | grep public.data`

### Verifying App Extension Installation

QLStephenSwift uses the modern App Extension architecture (`.appex`), not legacy Quick Look Generators (`.qlgenerator`). To verify and manage the extension, use the `pluginkit` command:

**List all Quick Look Preview extensions:**
```bash
pluginkit -m -p com.apple.quicklook.preview
```

**Find QLStephenSwift extension specifically:**
```bash
pluginkit -m -i com.mycometg3.qlstephenswift.qlstephenswiftpreview
```

Alternatively, filter by protocol:
```bash
pluginkit -m -p com.apple.quicklook.preview | grep -i qlstephen
```

**Force re-register the extension (if not appearing):**
```bash
pluginkit -a /Applications/QLStephenSwift.app/Contents/PlugIns/QLStephenSwiftPreview.appex
```

**Note:** The `qlmanage` command is useful for testing previews and clearing caches, but `pluginkit` is the proper tool for managing App Extension-based Quick Look plugins. Legacy `.qlgenerator` plugins are deprecated in modern macOS versions.
